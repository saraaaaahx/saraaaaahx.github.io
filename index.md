## Mind Your Words
### Spoken word platform for mental health discussion 

We are working to build a platform for UCL students to share experiences with mental health and share their individual journeys. 
This narrative space is created for poem, prose, song, videos, photography, theatre and anything creative 
One might chose to contribute anonymously, or reveal their identities in their entries 



Take a look at my [article](http://pimediaonline.co.uk/category/lifestyle/) on narrative-based spaces as a response to the mental health crisis in higher education.
